RISC OS port of the Subversion client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"The goal of the Subversion project is to build a version control
system that is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source
community.  The software is released under an Apache/BSD-style open
source license."
This file details RISC OS specific aspects, for more infomation about
Subversion in general, please see http://subversion.tigris.org or
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/book.html

Subversion is currently *Alpha*, so some features may not be fully
implemented, or may contain bugs. This port can only access repositories via
http, and not (currently) local repositories.

RISC OS version 0.03 (21-Jan-03), a port of version 0.17

Usage
~~~~~
Make sure !SVN has been booted, then use it as you would use the command
line client under unix. All filenames should be specified in unix
format, rather than RISC OS format, eg svn diff foo/bar.c rather than
svn diff foo.c.bar

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Theo Markettos' CryptRandom module.
Peter Naulls' UnixHome from http://www.chocky.org/unix/downloads/
(Subversion will work without UnixHome, but it will keep creating a
/subversion directory in your current directory.

Log mesages
~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have Justin Fletcher's EE program installed, then Subversion will
use that to allow you to edit log messages in you favorite text editor.
If not, then you will have to use the -m option on the command line to
specify the log message.

Filetypes
~~~~~~~~~
If you wish a file's filetype to be retained when it is added to a
repository, then you should specify its name with a comma and hex
filetype appended, in the same way as John Tytgat's CVS port works.
eg.
svn add !Boot
Adds the file !Boot without any filetype information. When it is checked
out from the repository, it will have its filetype set to text.
svn add !Boot,feb
Adds the file !Boot, with the filetype &feb (Obey). The file will retain
its filetype when it is checked out.

Subversion also supports properties, which allow arbitrary metadata
to be attached to a file. This would be ideal for storing filetype
information without having to alter the filename as is currently needed,
so I intend to use this in the future (however the current method may
still be useful in some situations, and so will be retained as an
alternative to the properties).

Known Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~
Merging changes from a repository into a locally modified file is
likely to fail.

TODO
~~~~
Things that I'm intending to do in the future:
Add support for local repository access (requires some additions to
UnixLib first)
Support filetypes as properties
Keep the RISC OS port up to date

Things that I'm unlikely to be doing:
Porting the subversion server (this would require a port of Apache2
first)
Writing a subversion GUI (this doesn't stop anyone else from writing one
though)

Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~
Source code is currently available on request, but I intend to submit
all suitable modifications for inclusion in the main Subversion source
tree.

useful, please let me know at mailto:alex@alexwaugh.com
