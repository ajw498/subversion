Important
=========

This version of Subversion by default uses a different method of
storing filetypes than previous versions. Please read the filetypes
section of the !SVN/!Help file before using it, then either ensure the
svn$filetypeext variable is set or convert your repository to the new
method. See the ReadMe in the convertfiletypes directory for more
information about converting.
